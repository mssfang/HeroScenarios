# HeroScenarios #

__SDK__ <br />
*Run ConversationAIPipelineSDK.java at src/main/ConversationAIPipelineSDK.java* <br />

__API__ <br />
_since maven library for azure-cognitiveservices-contentmoderator is using version 1.0.2-beta, but API sample required version 0.0.1-beta, so the Conversation AI Pipeline by using API is not working now_  <br />
~~Run ConversationAIPipelineSample.java, at src/main/ConversationAIPipelineSample.java~~  <br />
