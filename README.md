# HeroScenarios #

__SDK__
*Run ConversationAIPipelineSDK.java at src/main/ConversationAIPipelineSDK.java*

__API__
_since maven library for azure-cognitiveservices-contentmoderator is using version 1.0.2-beta, but API sample required version 0.0.1-beta, so the Conversation AI Pipeline by using API is not working now_
~~Run ConversationAIPipelineSample.java, at src/main/ConversationAIPipelineSample.java~~
